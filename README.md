# TETRIS

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Soviet
Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984 for the Electronika 60. The game has been
published by several companies over time, most prominently during a war for the appropriation
of the game's rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by Nintendo, the rights of the
game reverted to Pajitnov in 1996, who co-founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers to manage licensing for Tetris.

Tetris challenges the player to create complete lines by moving differently-shaped pieces – the tetrominoes, which scroll 
from the top to bottom of the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed
to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled to the point that additional pieces can no longer descend.
The longer the player can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher their score will be. In multiplayer games, the players must last
longer than their opponents, and in certain versions, players can inflict penalties on opponents by completing a significant number
of lines. Some adaptations have provided variations to the game's theme, such as three-dimensional displays or a system for reserving 
pieces.

Built on simple rules and requiring intelligence and skill, Tetris has established itself as one of the greatest video games ever made.
Since its creation, Tetris has sold 202 million copies – approximately 70 million physical units and 132 million paid mobile game 
downloads – as of December 2011, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time
